TEXT1=Welcome to the Critical Site Network Tool
TEXT2=Welcome to the Critical Site Network Tool. The CSN Tool has been jointly developed by Wetlands International, BirdLife International and the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP - WCMC) to deliver and map information on migratory waterbirds in the framework of the Wings Over Wetlands (WOW) Project. The Tool combines and integrates information on BirdLife International's Important Bird Areas, Wetlands International's International Waterbird Census sites, Ramsar sites and other protected areas and includes data for all waterbird species and bio-geographical populations in the region including those covered by the African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement. You can search by species or site and easily customize your query and produce reports. The help page includes a comprehensive user guide in English. The WOW partners are hoping to be able to offer the user guide also in other languages in the near future.
